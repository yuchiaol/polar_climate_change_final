# 19. Arctic-Midlatitude Linkage

> Arctic-Midlatitude Linkage has been hotly discussed and debated in the past years. [Here's an an article on “CarbonBrief”](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-is-arctic-warming-linked-to-polar-vortext-other-extreme-weather?fbclid=IwAR3IdscKbEHYVgGdkInmUMBzArEswKu51fGUOQG4OazrNg5MqXQUtQ5hWkQ).

## Brief history of Arctic mid-latitude linkage study

- 1914: Swedish meteorologist Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson  
- 1924: Russian oceanographer Wlaimir Juljewitsch Wiese
- 1973: R. L. Newson published a Nature paper, which used GCM to study Arctic sea-ice impacts on the atmosphere.  
- 2010: J. A. Screen published a Nature paper, which showed that Arctic sea ice plays a central role in Arctic Amplification.
- 2012: J. A. Francis and S. T. Vavrus published a GRL paper, which linked Arctic warming to extreme events in midlatitudes.
- 2013: Elizabeth A. Barnes’s GRL paper (argued the Arctic-midlatitude linkage).
- 2014: J. M. Wallace’s Science paper.
- 2014: J. Cohen’s review paper on Nature Geoscience (stratosphere).
- 2020: J. Cohen’s review paper on Nature Climate Change (divergent consensus)

## Arctic warming and mid-latitude Rossby waves

Francis and  Vavrus (2012) GRL paper was among the first to propose that Arctic warming could affect mid-latitude extreme 
via altering large-scale atmospheric waves. However, the comtemporary studies showed weak, or opposite results.

## Proposed mechanisms

- Waiver jet stream
  - north-south temperature gradient + Rossby wave (Francis & Vavrus 2012).
  - storm tracks + NAO/AO (Cohen & Barow 2005; Deser et al. 2007; Honda et al. 2009).
  - warm Arctic-cold continents (WACC) pattern (Cohen et al. 2014).
  - [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuHdPvnu3Ds&feature=emb_logo).
- Polar vorrtex 
  - SSW breakdown (Kim et al. 2014; Kretchmer et al. 2018).
  - [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YaLbJIycVE&feature=emb_logo)
- Wave resonance
  - in summer season only (Petoukhov et al. 2013)
  - the theory of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA, Coumou et al. 2014; Mann et al. 2017)

## Observational and GCM inconsistency

- Jet stream
- NAO
- Arctic Amplification and Severe Weather Events
- Sources of Disagreement in Model Experiments
- Large internal atmospheric variability -> low signal-to-noise ratio
- Causality

a Emergent constraint based on the ensemble regression (ER) between eddy momentum feedback and the zonal wind response index (ZWRI). Black line shows the regression with hatching showing the 95% confidence interval. Horizontal green line shows the constrained ensemble mean response, with the shading showing its 95% confidence interval (Methods). Vertical black line and grey shading shows the mean and range of eddy feedback from the reanalyses. Ellipses show the 95% uncertainties obtained by bootstrapping with replacement the ensemble members. b As a but for the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) response. A one-sided test is used to calculate p values since we expect the response to increase as eddy feedback strengthens. All data are for DJF. Source: [Smith et al.
