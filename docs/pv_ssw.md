# Polar Stratospheric Circulation

```{note}
[StratObserve](https://stratobserve.com/) by Dr. Zachary D. Lawrence is very useful to monitor stratospheric conditions.
```

### Stratospheric polar vortex

### Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW)

### Definition of SSW

The most widely used definition of SSW is following [Charlton and Polvani (2007)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/3/jcli3996.1.xml):

“the reversal of the daily-mean zonal-mean zonal winds from westerly to easterly at 60◦ N latitude and 10 hPa from November to April (by CP07, wind reversals must be separated by 20 consecutive days of westerly winds and must return to westerly for at least 10 consecutive days prior to 30 April, to be classified as a mid-winter SSW.).“

Temperature information can be dropped because of thermal wind balance!

### SSW dynamical frameworks

- Large-scale planetary wave propagating upward
  - Planetary wave propagating upward – Charney-Drazin criterion 
  - Baroclinic instability
  - Upscale cascade from synoptic-scale waves
  - Topography
  - Land-sea contrast
- Planetary Wave Forcing
  - SSWs only happen with sufficiently strong planetary wave forcing from the troposphere.
  - SSWs require a pulse of anomalously strong wave forcing from the troposphere to initiate.“
  - Wave1 -> bottom-up
  - Wave2 -> top-down
- Wave-mean flow interactions and dissipation
  - EP flux
  - Heat budget analysis
  - PV perspective

### External influences on SSWs

- QBO 
- ENSO 
- 11-year solar cycle 
- MJO
- snow cover
- sea ice

### Dynamical downward propagation

Tropospheric anomalies should be proportional to stratospheric ones!

- Wave driving (EP flux divergence) -> downward control (x)
- Wave absorption and reflection. (x)
- Baroclinic eddies (v)
- Stratospheric PV anomalies (v? too weak)

### Surface signature of SSW’s downward influences

- Midlatitude surface impacts
- Oceanic impacts
- Tropical impacts

### Two-way coupling of troposphere and stratosphere

The reanalysis is shown with red bars. The differences between historical simulations and future scenarios projections are significant at the 95% confidence level for a few months, marked with a pentagram over the corresponding scenarios.

Satellite impact on forecasts of SSW onset in an extreme case. JRA‐55 (red line) and JRA‐55C (blue line) ensemble forecasts starting from D−10 are shownfor an SSW that occurred on 1 January 1985. Time series of (a) 30‐hPa temperature averaged northward of 70°N and (b) vertical component of 50‐hPa E‐P fluxthat averaged over 45–75°N. Thick lines and shades indicate the ensemble mean values and 0.5 standard deviations among ensemble members. JRA‐55 andJRA‐55C are also shown by dotted lines. (c) Three‐dimensional distributions of the vortex edges (isolines of the vertically weighted potential vorticity), of thestratospheric polar vortex, for a 7‐day forecast field (validated at 3 days before D0). As a vortex edge, 38 PVU contours of Lait's PV at isothermal surfaces are plottedfor each ensemble forecasts (cf. Matthewman et al. 2009). Thick lines indicate the ensemble means.
