# 5. Glaciers

```{note}
[The Randolph Glacier Inventory](https://www.glims.org/rgi_user_guide/welcome.html) is a global inventaroy of glacier outlines. This is cool!!! You could play around it.
```

## Glacier types
- Alpine glaciers
- Continental ice sheets

## Climate conditions for glaciers
- High snowfall in winter + cool temperature in summer
- Accumulated snow transforms into firn and then ice
- In polar and alpine regions 
- Sources and losses

## Locations of glaciers

## The life cycle of a glacier

- Snow -> granular ice -> firn -> glacial ice
- Zones of accumulation and ablation

## Moraines

A moraine is an accumulation of loose (unconsolidated) debris – dirt and pieces of rock – that is carried along by a glacier and deposited at some point during the glacier's journey. Source: [here](https://mammothmemory.net/geography/geography-vocabulary/glacial-landscapes/moraine.html)

## Glacier observations and modelling
- In situ and airborne survey
- Satellite observations (e.g., GRACE)
- [NCAR Land Ice Working Group](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/Land+Ice/)
- [Python Glacier Evolution Model](https://github.com/drounce/PyGEM/wiki)

(a) Time series of June–August (JJA) melt (mm water equivalent [mmWE]/month; dashed line) from the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional simulation and June–August near-surface temperature at 2-m height (T2m; °C; solid line) from ERA-Interim reanalysis averaged over Greenland for 1979–2015, with red dots indicating summers with extreme melt, defined as those with T2m in the top decile. JJA composite anomalies for top decile melt summers relative to the 1980–2009 mean for (b) melt (mmWE/month) and (c) Z500 (m). Stippling indicates anomalies statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Figure from [Hahn et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL079682)
