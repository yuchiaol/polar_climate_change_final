    "The zero-dimensional energy balance model discussed in previous lecture does not contain vertical distribution of the atmosphere, which is important in understanding climate change. We will introduce the simple two-layer model, simple three-layer model, and n-layer model. These models will pave a road for understanding Manabe's radiative-convective equilibrium that will be discussed in the next lecture. Before these, let's start with radiation process in the atmosphere.\n",

    "We can construct a 30-layer model by hand, but it could be challenging and not feasible. Therefore, it would be useful, and sometimes helpful, to konw [climlab](https://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), developed by Professor Brian E. J. Rose. Let's start with a few examples: [here](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/grey-radiation-climlab.html). We will see how to construct a 30-layer model, which seems not feasible for solving the equations analytically.\n",
