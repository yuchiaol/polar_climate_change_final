(c) Three‐dimensional distributions of the vortex edges (isolines of the vertically weighted potential vorticity), of thestratospheric polar vortex, for a 7‐day forecast field (validated at 3 days before D0). As a vortex edge, 38 PVU contours of Lait's PV at isothermal surfaces are plottedfor each ensemble forecasts (cf. Matthewman et al. 2009). Thick lines indicate the ensemble means.
