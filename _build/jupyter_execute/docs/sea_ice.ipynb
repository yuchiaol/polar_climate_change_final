    "Idealized representation of the 21st century sea ice system with and without Arctic Ice Management (AIM). In unperturbed winter conditions (top left) the sea ice and snow act as insulator reducing the heat flux from the warmer ocean to the much colder atmosphere. The sea ice growth takes place mostly at the ice-ocean interface and is relatively slow (dark blue fraction of the ice floes). By summer (bottom left) most of the ice has melted, leading to an ice-free Arctic Ocean in the second half of the century and amplifying the warming through the ice-albedo feedback (yellow fraction of ocean). In AIM conditions (top right) ocean water is pumped onto the ice, leading to larger heat flux and rapid ice growth at the surface. More ice withstands the summer melt (bottom right) and increases the surface albedo. Source: [Zampieri and  Goessling (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019EF001230).\n",
