JJA composite anomalies for top decile melt summers relative to the 1980–2009 mean for (b) melt (mmWE/month) and (c) Z500 (m). Stippling indicates anomalies statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Figure from [Hahn et al. (2018)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL079682)\n",
