# 2. Overview of Arctic and Antarctic

### Arctic and Antarctic definitions

> \"The region surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land.
> This ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth;
> and because of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique.\"
> -- [NSIDC All About Arctic Climatology and Meteorology](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/arctic-meteorology/index.html)

- 66° 34' N
- Summer and winter solstices
- Arctic tree line
- Average daily summer temperature is not higher than 10° Celsius (50° Fahrenheit)

### Arctic and Antarctic exploration

- Brief histroy
- Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate [(MOSAiC)](https://mosaic-expedition.org/)
- [Dr Ying-Chih Fang](https://mosaic-expedition.org/profile/ying-chih-fang/) was particitating in MOSAiC project.
